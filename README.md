# Artie-3000-Coding

A collection of programs for Artie 3000 developed in Southern California by John Wyatt at Educational Insights. 
These freely provided programs expand the skills of your coding robot and provide a basis for learning how to 
develop unique software of your own. 

The current list of programs and their descriptions can be found below:

1) Spin Around!

A basic program that could be used as a reaction animation when Artie is excited.

2) Random Shapes

Randomly draws shapes from a predetermined library in uniform pattern. Length of drawing, 
which shapes are drawn, and size of grid can all be changed by the user. 

3) Basic Shapes (In Development)

4) Random Snowflake

5) Better Letters (In Development)

6) Printing To Console and Random Library

This is a basic demonstration of how to print to the console for debugging and how to use the random library to generate random numbers.
